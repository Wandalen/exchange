# Decisions Doc Definition

### Scope

- **Purpose**: Record genuine judgment calls behind this crate's design, so a later reader finds the rejected alternatives instead of re-litigating them.
- **Responsibility**: ADR-style records — the question, the options considered, the choice, and why.
- **In Scope**: Decisions about this crate's own public surface.
- **Out of Scope**: Decisions closed in another crate (→ that crate's own `decisions/`).

### Overview Table

| ID | Name | Purpose | Status |
|----|------|---------|--------|
